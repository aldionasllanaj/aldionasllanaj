I interact with a lot of computng systems in my day for example my phone where i do everything , call , text, listen to music ect; I use my computer and my laptop at home to do my homeworks. I use my Alexa which can tell me anything i want or play music.I have interact with my TV where i can watch different movies. 
Computing systems have made my and everybody's life easier because we can do whatever we want wherever we are with out phone, we can do our homeworks easier with out computer, we can have fun and find anything we want with Alexa
